              <blockquote class="blockquote"> The most profound effects of social tools lag their invention by years, because it isn't until they have a critical mass of adopters, adopters who take these tools for granted, that their real effects begin to appear. </blockquote>

              <p> Through engaging storytelling, Gleick takes the reader from the <em>history</em> of information, beginning with African drums, to its <em>theory</em>, beginning with Shannon, to its <i>flood</i>: </p>
              <blockquote class="blockquote"> As the printing press, the telegraph, the typewriter, the telephone, the radio, the computer, and the Internet prospered, each in its turn, people said, as if for the first time, that a new burden had been placed on human communication: new complexity, new detachment and a frightening new excess. </blockquote>
